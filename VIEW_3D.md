# 🏠 3D Dollhouse Viewer - Quick Start

## 🚀 How to View Your Scenes in 3D

### Step 1: Start the Web Server

```bash
cd /Users/parmansangha/3D_Modeler
python3 server.py
```

The server will:

- Start on `http://localhost:8000`
- Automatically open your browser
- Serve the 3D viewer

### Step 2: View Your Scene

**Option A: Load demo scene automatically**

- If `demo_scene.json` exists, it will load automatically

**Option B: Upload a JSON file**

- Click "Choose File" in the viewer
- Select any `.json` file generated by the modeler
- The scene will render in 3D!

### Step 3: Interact with the 3D View

**Mouse Controls:**

- **Left Click + Drag**: Rotate the camera
- **Right Click + Drag**: Pan the view
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out

**Buttons:**

- **Reset View**: Return to dollhouse camera angle
- **Toggle Wireframe**: Show/hide wireframe mode
- **Toggle Labels**: Show/hide room labels
- **Dollhouse View**: Enable/disable isometric view

## 🎨 What You'll See

The 3D viewer renders:

- ✅ **Walls** (exterior in light gray, interior in darker gray)
- ✅ **Rooms** (colored floors by room type)
- ✅ **Doors** (brown frames)
- ✅ **Windows** (blue transparent frames)
- ✅ **Furniture** (3D boxes representing items)
- ✅ **Room Labels** (text above each room)

## 📝 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate a new scene
python3 cli.py "A modern 2-bedroom apartment" -o my_apartment.json

# 2. Start the viewer server
python3 server.py

# 3. In the browser, click "Choose File" and select my_apartment.json

# 4. Enjoy your 3D dollhouse view! 🎉
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**

- Make sure port 8000 is available
- Try: `python3 server.py` (should show the URL)

**Scene doesn't load?**

- Check that your JSON file is valid: `python3 -m json.tool your_file.json`
- Make sure the file is in the same directory

**Browser shows blank?**

- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

**Can't see the scene?**

- Click "Reset View" button
- Try zooming out (scroll wheel)
- Check that the JSON has rooms, walls, etc.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Generate multiple scenes** and compare them in the viewer
2. **Use dollhouse view** for the best overview
3. **Toggle wireframe** to see the structure clearly
4. **Rotate and zoom** to inspect details

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate and view immediately
python3 cli.py "A scandinavian apartment" -o scene.json && python3 server.py

# View existing scene
python3 server.py
# Then upload scene.json in the browser
```

Enjoy your 3D architectural visualizations! 🏗️✨
